 | **Denial‑Of‑Service (DoS) Attack**| Is the withdrawal pattern followed to prevent denial of service?                    | To prevent denial of service attacks during withdrawals, it's critical to follow the withdrawal pattern best practices – pull‑based approach.                       |
 |                                   | Is there a minimum transaction amount enforced?                                     | Enforcing a minimum transaction amount can prevent attackers from clogging the network with zero‑amount or dust transactions.                                      |
 |                                   | How does the protocol handle tokens with blacklisting functionality?                | Tokens with blacklisting capabilities, such as USDC, can pose unique risks and challenges to protocols.                                                             |
 |                                   | Can forcing the protocol to process a queue lead to DoS?                           | Forcing protocols to process queues, like a queue of dust withdrawals, can be exploited to cause a denial of service.                                              |
 |                                   | What happens with low decimal tokens that might cause DoS?                         | Tokens with low decimals can present issues where the transaction process fails due to rounding to zero amounts.                                                   |
 |                                   | Does the protocol handle external contract interactions safely?                    | Protocols must handle interactions with external contracts in a way that does not compromise their functionality if external dependencies fail.                   |
 | **Donation Attack**               | Does the protocol rely on `balance` or `balanceOf` instead of internal accounting? | Attackers can manipulate the accounting by donating tokens.                                                                                                         |
 | **Front‑running Attack**          | Are “get‑or‑create” patterns protected against front‑running attacks?              | Functions combining resource creation and interaction (e.g. `getOrCreateAndUse`) are vulnerable to front‑running attacks where parameters can be manipulated.       |
 |                                   | Are two‑transaction actions designed to be safe from front‑running?                | Actions split across two calls may be vulnerable to attackers intervening between them.                                                                            |
 |                                   | Can users maliciously cause others’ transactions to revert by preempting with dust?| Attackers may fail legitimate transactions by front‑running with negligible‑value calls.                                                                           |
 |                                   | Is the protocol using a properly user‑bound commit‑reveal scheme?                  | On‑chain actions exposed in the mempool enable front‑running and information leaks; schemes must tie commitments to user addresses and parameters.                  |
 | **Griefing Attack**               | Is there an external function that relies on states that can be changed by others?| Malicious actors can block user transactions by tweaking on‑chain state.                                                                                            |
 |                                   | Can contract operations be manipulated with precise gas limit specifications?     | Attackers supply exact gas to force specific execution paths, altering contract behavior unexpectedly.                                                              |
 | **Miner Attack**                  | Is `block.timestamp` used for time‑sensitive operations?                          | Miners can adjust timestamps by several seconds, affecting time‑dependent logic.                                                                                    |
 |                                   | Is the contract using block properties (timestamp, difficulty) for randomness?     | Predictable block values are insecure for randomness and can be influenced by miners.                                                                              |
 |                                   | Is contract logic sensitive to transaction ordering?                              | Miners control ordering and can exploit front‑running, back‑running, or sandwich attacks.                                                                           |
 | **Price Manipulation Attack**     | Is the price calculated by the ratio of token balances?                           | Price derived from balance ratios can be manipulated via flash loans or donations.                                                                                 |
 |                                   | Is the price calculated from DEX liquidity pool spot prices?                      | Spot‑price readings from pools can be manipulated via flash loans that temporarily drain liquidity.                                                                 |
 | **Reentrancy Attack**             | Is there a view function that can return a stale value?                          | Read‑only reentrancy: view functions may report inconsistent state if reentered, tricking other protocols into unwanted actions.                                     |
 |                                   | Is there any state change after interaction with an external contract?            | Untrusted external calls can callback, causing multiple withdrawals or out‑of‑order events.                                                                          |
 | **Replay Attack**                 | Are there protections against replay attacks for failed transactions?             | Failed transactions may be replayed if not properly protected.                                                                                                      |
 |                                   | Is there protection against replaying signatures on different chains?             | Signatures valid on one chain can be replayed on another, causing breaches.                                                                                         |
 | **Rug Pull**                      | Can the admin of the protocol pull assets?                                        | Some protocols grant admins power to withdraw protocol assets, posing centralization and rug‑pull risks.                                                            |
 | **Sandwich Attack**               | Does the protocol have explicit slippage protection?                              | Attackers monitor mempool, sandwich large trades by manipulating price before and after user’s transaction.                                                        |
 | **Sybil Attack**                  | Is there a mechanism depending on the number of users?                            | Quorum or reward systems based on user count can be manipulated by creating many addresses.                                                                         |
